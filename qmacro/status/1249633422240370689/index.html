  	      @wombling 'x' to me represents 'whatever is passed in' which is of course eas[y|ier] to say in a dynamically typed lang like this. I almost want to draw attention *away from* rather than *towards* succinct (and 1 line) functions as building blocks that are custom but easy to produce.

  	      @wombling Your comment about expression in a few lines is in line with that idea. Break the problem down into manageable pieces, and then build the solution from those pieces. While carefully avoiding overengineering each piece. That I guess is the underlying philosophy.
